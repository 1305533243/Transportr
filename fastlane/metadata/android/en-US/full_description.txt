Transportr is a non-profit app developed by people around the world to make
using public transport as easy as possible wherever you are.

Currently, it works best in Europe, but also supports many places world-wide. If
you live in an unsupported area, consider adding it to Transportr.
Instructions are available on the homepage.

Transportr finds directions from your home, your current position or a given station to
wherever you want to go. You can also save entire trips as favorites and find
next trips with one swipe. Of course, you can also show your trip on the map
and follow your progress via GPS.

You can also discover nearby stations and show upcoming departures including the delays (if
there are any).
